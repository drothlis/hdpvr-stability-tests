Stress tests for the Hauppauge HD PVR video-capture device
==========================================================

Scripts to reproduce a lock-up of the HD PVR that is only fixed by
power-cycling the device.

Usage
-----

::

    ./gst-launch-start-stop.sh /dev/video0 > hdpvr.log
    ./gst-launch-start-stop-report.py hdpvr.log

Dependencies
------------

* gstreamer
* gstreamer-plugins-good (for v4l2src etc)
* gstreamer-plugins-bad-free (for mpegtsdemux)
* gstreamer-ffmpeg (from rpmfusion or your distro's equivalent; for H.264 decoder)
* GNU coreutils (for "timeout")
* python (tested with 2.7)

(Package names are from Fedora 17; you might have to do a little bit of
searching to find the equivalent package in other Linux distributions or other
operating systems.)

Results
-------

We tried all sorts of experiments: Adding a better heatsink to the H.264
encoder chip; adding a heatsink to the A/D chip; different kernel versions;
multiple HD PVRs connected to a single PC versus a single one. The only
significant improvement we found was from removing the lid and `adding fans`_
directly over the circuit board, but this doesn't cure the problem completely,
it only increases the time-to-failure. We've measured the surface temperature
of the encoder chip's heatsink, and of the A/D chip, and neither one was ever
observed to exceed 40Â°C (with the fan); but the HD PVR still fails.

Our measurements:

* All tests were run using `gst-launch-start-stop.sh`.
* "Failure" means a permanent lock-up; I ignored transient failures where the
  HDPVR continued working after stopping & re-starting recording.
* The runs with 3 simultaneous HDPVRs tended to also be the runs with fans,
  which could explain the longer running times. Of the 3 HDPVRs, the first to
  fail was usually one of the 2 on the same USB controller. Note that we did
  observe failures with the fan and a single HDPVR per PC.
